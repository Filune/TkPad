## Usage
To use TkPad, simply run the application using a Python 3 interpreter. The graphical user interface will be displayed, presenting a blank text area where users can start typing. An alternative way of running the application is to head over to the release page and download the application from there.

## Dependencies
TkPad relies on Python 3, striprtf, and the Tkinter library, which is a standard GUI toolkit for Python. Ensure that both Tkinter and striprtf are installed before running the application. Striprtf can be installed through pip using `pip install striprtf`.
